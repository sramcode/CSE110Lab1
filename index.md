## Who Am I?
Hi! My name is Sonika and I am a second year computer science student at UCSD. I have experience with mainly Java, C, and C++. I am currently learning Javascript and HTML/CSS, and I love it so far. In my free time, I love to bake, watch the sunset, and get coffee! My favorite tv show at the moment is Criminal Minds, and I *love* to discover new music.
